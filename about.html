              </h2>
              <p>I am the result of a classic nuclear middle class family, two parents, still happily married, one sibling. I went to public school, achieved a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at a public university. While I did get that computer degree and many of my jobs used it, I was never happy with any them past the first one. I wish I could have stayed at that first one. My company was bought and the company that bought us had their own in-house IT department with no desire to inherit any of us, more fool them. Not to rant about coding, but I miss the days when you were more or less left alone to handle your coding rather than the group or pair programming bunk that has cropped up to, in my mind, only prop up subpar developers that have no business in the field. Nuf said.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">So I'm not happy as a Software Dev and tried to get out of dev work as a career a number of times. Branching into different paths like Business Analyst and Helpdesk or breaking completely out into a stint as a Realtor with limited returns on happy investment. My newest career attempt is one I have always been half-working on, but I will now be attempting to devote all of my free time to it. That of AUTHOR! This means every free moment rather than only when I'm bored. I hope you follow me on this journey and get some enjoyment out of the adventure!</p>
