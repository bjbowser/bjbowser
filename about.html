                    <p class="lead mb-5">Thank you for being interested in me! I promise to do my best to not bore you and, for that reason, this about section is very slim, condensed and can't be considered anywhere near a complete story of my life so far!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am the result of a classic nuclear middle class family, two parents, still happily married, one sibling.  I went to public school, achieved a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at a public university. While I did get that computer degree and many of my jobs used it, I was never happy with any them past the first one. I wish I could have stayed at that first one. My company was bought and the company that bought us had their own in-house IT department with no desire to inherit any of us, more fool them. Not to rant about coding, but I miss the days when you were more or less left alone to handle your coding rather than the group or pair programming bunk that has cropped up to, in my mind, only prop up subpar developers that have no business in the field. Nuf said.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">So I tried a number of different career paths inbetween your basic software developer of varied languages. Database Administrator, Realtor, Police Officer <span style="font-size: 8pt"> Fun Fact: one of the main reasons I got my degree in comp sci was to be able to apply to the FBI. Not fun fact: I never applied because when I was ready to, I discovered I was too old to start the process</span>, Data Scientist, Business Analyst and now... <span style="font-weight: bold">AUTHOR!</span> </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I honestly should have always followed the author route at the same time as the other stuff! I have always LOVED to write.  Not until more recently did I bother to send any of my pieces to be published with some small success. So, writing is now my main focus, as long as I can continue to wrangle it with everything else! In high school even, I had about half of a novel all written and was very proud of it! That is, until I was in college and re-read it. I haven't deleted it, I might go back later and make it presentable. Right now, I'm focused on a fantasy fiction novel and very excited about finishing it!!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Thank you for reading!  I will write posts as on this site as often as I can and keep my subscribers updated of any and all major news! <span style="font-weight: bold">Choose to Subcribe for a free list of curated, by yours truly, suggested novels!</span></p>
