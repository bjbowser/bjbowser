              <p>If you are wondering that this seems rather fast to get responses... I feel the same way! From my previous posting, I was only talking about some other places I may write stories that meet their criteria and submit to them. I understand that Literary Gamut Agency, which is holding weekly contests until Christmas, would have to pick their winners quickly. The other story, however, I did not expect to be selected so quickly especially as the deadline to submit is 12/24. I figured I wouldn't hear anything at least until the deadline, but no, I heard the day after I sent my submission that it was accepted! I have never been so happy to be wrong!</p>
              <p>First, my Holiday Story, <a href="https://literarygamut.com/writing/f/2nd-week-winner---holiday-short-story#02838a84-9734-4678-8b08-47acb4818117">'The First Special Edition: Christmas Issue'</a>, is based on the main character of my current (as of 12/18/2020) work in progress novel, Lillian Erban. It's loosely a holiday story as Christmas is more the setting than the plot. Instead, this holiday story is more about redemption. Lillian has made a serious mistake and her friends are snubbing her during Christmas break, the best time to hang out with friends, because of that mistake. Read the story to find out if she fix her mistake quickly enough! Click on the name of the short story to be sent to the site of the wonderful editor who setup the Christmas contest!</p>
              <p>Secondly, I wrote a nonfiction short story based on a conversation I had with my father about my grandfather and heard recently it was also accepted! This one, 'Good Samaritan' is a nonfiction story written by me of a conversation between my father and grandmother of an injustice that happened in 1970s. I didn't know that my grandfather was so good a person as to do what he did until long after his death :( I wish he hadn't hidden his involvement, but I won't attack him posthumously. I'm sure he had his reasons. I will update this page as soon as my story gets published on their site, please check daily. And please do not hestitate to donate to their <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/essential-americans">gofundme</a>. They are using the written language to fight social injustice, telling nonfiction stories to make real change! They have published a memoir which enabled a Vietnam Vet, who had earned a purple heart but wasn't given it, to get his purple heart once A Word With You Press published his story.</p>
